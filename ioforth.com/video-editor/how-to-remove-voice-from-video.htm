                </div>
                <p>There are several reasons why anyone would want to learn how to remove voice from video clips. Perhaps, you shot a great video on a fun day, but the noise in the background kept ruining it for you. Or, maybe you simply want to do a clean voiceover on an existing video and need to keep the film completely quiet to effectively get your message across.</p>
<p>Thanks to 20th-century technology, it is pretty easy to remove voice from video clips, and in this tutorial, you will learn how to get rid of annoying sounds from your videos in less than 5 minutes using your Windows 10 PC and mobile devices!</p>
<h2>How to Remove Audio from Video in Windows 10</h2>
<p>Ever since the removal of <a href="https://www.ioforth.com/filmforth/">Windows Movie Maker</a>, people are finding it hard getting used to the new Microsoft Photos, which has become a replacement for the discontinued video editor.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Microsoft Photos can be used to do quite a few things, including getting rid of sound from your videos.</p>
<p>So many people can’t figure it out, but in this section, I’ll show you how it’s done. Let’s jump into it!</p>
<h3>Step 1: Open the Microsoft Photos App</h3>
<p>If you can’t find your Microsoft Photos app right away, simply tap on the Windows Icon on the bottom left corner of your screen and start typing &#8220;Photos,&#8221; the Microsoft Photos icon will show up. Click on it, and you&#8217;ll be taken into the app.</p>
<p>Done? Great!</p>
<p>Now, it&#8217;s time for the real stuff.</p>
<h3>Step 2: Select Video Editor and Start a New Video Project</h3>
<p>At the top right corner of the Microsoft Photos app, you will see an array of options: Collections, Albums, People, Folders, and Video Editor.</p>
<p>Select a video editor. On the new window, select New Video Project.</p>
<div id="attachment_130" style="width: 990px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-130" src="https://www.ioforth.com/video-editor/img/how-to-remove-voice-from-video-1.png" alt="Select New Video Project" width="980" height="522" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Select New Video Project</p></div>
<p>When you click on New Video Project, you&#8217;ll be prompted to input a file name. You can choose to add a file name or simply select skip.</p>
<h3>Step 3: Add your Video</h3>
<p>First, click on Add. If you have stored your videos on your PC, select From this PC, navigate to where you&#8217;ve stored your video, and select it.</p>
<div id="attachment_131" style="width: 990px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-131" src="https://www.ioforth.com/video-editor/img/how-to-remove-voice-from-video-2.png" alt="Project Library" width="980" height="518" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Project Library</p></div>
<p>The video will show up in the Project Library section. Now it’s time to remove the sound from your video.</p>
<h3>Step 4: Remove the Sound</h3>
<p>Drag the video from the Project Library to the Storyboard section.</p>
<div id="attachment_132" style="width: 990px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-132" src="https://www.ioforth.com/video-editor/img/how-to-remove-voice-from-video-3.png" alt="Remove the Sound" width="980" height="521" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Remove the Sound</p></div>
<p>Next, tap on the sound icon on the video thumbnail twice. This will mute the sound of the audio.<br />
Mission completed!</p>
<p>You can now proceed with saving the new video.</p>
<p>To be fair, using Microsoft Photos for removing voice from videos is not easy for most people. So if you’d like to do this way faster and easier, we have a solution for you.</p>

<p>Now, how do you remove voice from video clips with FilmForth? Let’s check out the steps below!</p>
<h3>Step 1: Install and Launch FilmForth</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9nsf023x0mqs?cid=articledownload">Click here to get the app for free</a>. Once you’re on the page, click on Get. For me, the entire installation process took between 3 to 5 minutes. Once the installation is complete, launch the app, and you&#8217;ll be ready to roll.</p>
<h3>Step 2: Upload your Video</h3>
<p>Once you’ve launched the app, click on New Project to begin.</p>
<div id="attachment_134" style="width: 990px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-134" src="https://www.ioforth.com/video-editor/img/filmforth-overview.png" alt="FilmForth Overview" width="980" height="495" /><p class="wp-caption-text">FilmForth Overview</p></div>
<p>You will be immediately required to add a name to your project. FilmForth has already chosen the best aspect ratio and storage path for your video. So if you’re a newbie, no need to make any changes. Hit Create, and you&#8217;ll be taken to the project window.</p>
<div id="attachment_135" style="width: 990px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-135" src="https://www.ioforth.com/video-editor/img/create-a-new-project.png" alt="Create A New Project" width="980" height="495" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Create A New Project</p></div>
<p>To upload your video, click on Add Video/Photo Clips, and you&#8217;ll be taken to your storage area. Navigate to where you&#8217;ve stored your video, select it, and hit Open.</p>
<div id="attachment_136" style="width: 990px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-136" src="https://www.ioforth.com/video-editor/img/add-video-photo.png" alt="Add Video/Photo Clips" width="980" height="485" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Add Video/Photo Clips</p></div>
<p>Now that you’ve added your video, you can now remove the audio!</p>
<h3>Step 3: Remove the Sound</h3>
<p>This is the easiest part. Simply tap on the video on the storyboard to reveal a set of editing options for your video. Select Detach Audio.</p>
<div id="attachment_138" style="width: 990px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-138" src="https://www.ioforth.com/video-editor/img/how-to-remove-voice-from-video-4.png" alt="Select Detach Audio" width="980" height="496" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Select Detach Audio</p></div>
<p>A red bar will immediately appear under the video. Tap on the red bar and select Delete.</p>
<div id="attachment_139" style="width: 990px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-139" src="https://www.ioforth.com/video-editor/img/how-to-remove-voice-from-video-5.png" alt="Delete the Audio" width="980" height="496" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Delete the Audio</p></div>
<p>That’s it, the audio is gone!</p>
<p>You can now tap on the blue arrow button at the bottom left corner of the project window to proceed with saving your video.</p>
<h3>Step 4: Save your New Video</h3>
<p>Hit the blue Save button on the bottom right corner of the project window. You’ll be asked to choose your desired video quality, from 480p to 4K.</p>
<div id="attachment_140" style="width: 990px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-140" src="https://www.ioforth.com/video-editor/img/how-to-remove-voice-from-video-6.png" alt="Save New Video" width="980" height="496" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Save New Video</p></div>
<p>480p will make your video to export faster and have a smaller storage size. However, it will have relatively low quality.</p>
<p>FilmForth automatically chooses 720p, which is the best balance between size and quality. So it is recommended that you leave it at that default value.</p>
<p>That said, hit Save. You’ll need to give your new video a name. Afterward, hit Save again.<br />
You can now take a chill pill and wait for FilmForth to handle the rest.</p>
<h2>How to Mute Video on Mobile Devices for Free</h2>
<p>Perhaps you’re currently on the move and don’t have access to your laptop. Thus, you’re wondering if you can mute a video with your mobile device.</p>
<p>Of course, you can mute a video using your mobile phone. There are several apps on Google Play Store and Apple App Store that can help you mute a video on your mobile device.</p>
<p>However, they mostly work the same way:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open app</li>
<li>Upload video</li>
<li>Hit the mute button</li>
<li>Save</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus, there is no need to give you a list of 5 or 10 apps that just function the same way.<br />
Instead, I will list my two best free apps for muting videos on mobile. One would be for Android, and the other would be for iOS. Let’s get to it!</p>
<h3>Android: Mute Video By MSB Creations</h3>
<p>The name says it all. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.msbcreations.mutevideo">Mute Video</a> is very simple and allows you to quickly remove sound from your video without compromising the quality. Apart from just muting your video, the app also gives you the option to compress your video before export.</p>
<div id="attachment_141" style="width: 355px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-141 size-full" src="https://www.ioforth.com/video-editor/img/how-to-remove-voice-from-video-7.png" alt="Remove Voice on Android Device" width="345" height="284" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Remove Voice on Android Device</p></div>
<h3>iOS: Mute Videos By Maroun Abi Ramia</h3>
<p>This app has a similar name to the Android app above, but it is owned by another developer and is available for iOS users. Apart from merely muting your videos, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mute-videos/id1452775154">Mute Videos</a> also give you the option to trim your video before export.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>As you can see, removing annoying sound from your video is a pretty straightforward process. All you need is the right tool and a few minutes of your time.</p>
<p>I hope this tutorial was helpful, and you had some fun using FilmForth to mute your video. If you have any questions or suggestions about this feature, please feel free to leave a comment below. Cheers!</p>

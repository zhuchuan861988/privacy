<h2>How to Voice Over A Video</h2>
<p>Adding voice over the how-to and explanatory content often provide a much-needed overture to a video. It provides a personality to the video while amping up the information content.  Your video is easier to understand, plus their right voice can attract and make your audience feel bespoken to.</p>
<h3>How to Add Voice to Video?</h3>
<p>Several video platforms have started providing basic features such as adding Voice over a video while uploading it. For instance, you can add voice over a YouTube video from their in-built publishing dashboard itself.</p>
<p>While they may provide a quick-fix utility at hand, they lack customization and time-saving elements of a proper application designed for the very purpose. Add that on top of high speed and stable Internet, you have trouble at your hands. For Windows 10, we recommend FilmForth which gets the job done swiftly. Add voice to a video without waiting for anyone.</p>
<h4><strong>Step 1. Run FilmForth on your computer.</strong></h4>
<p>Go ahead and install FilmForth on your computer. It is available for Windows 10 through the Microsoft store. And then launch FilmForth and click on New Project.</p>
<p>Give the project a name of your choice. Also, select the location where you wish to save the project file. Click on Create. If you already have the video as a project, select it from recent projects as displayed on the home screen.</p>

<h4><strong>Step 2. Start to Add Voice Over to Video</strong></h4>
<p>First, you have to add a video to your project. Click on the Add Video/Photo Clips to add a video of your choice. Once the video has been added, click on the back arrow given on the left bottom corner of the screen.</p>
<div id="attachment_193" style="width: 754px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-193 " src="https://www.ioforth.com/video-editor/img/how-to-add-effects-to-videos-2.png" alt="Start to Add VoiceOver to Video" width="744" height="527" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Start to Add VoiceOver to Video</p></div>
<p>From the bottom of the dashboard, click on the audio option. There you will get two options.</p>
<ul>
<li>Add Audio: Add an existing audio file to go with the video.</li>
<li>Voice Over: Record voice using your microphone over a video</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Step 3. Start a Voice Record</strong></h4>
<p>Click on the microphone icon, and a permission wizard of Windows will appear on the screen. Give permission to FilmForth for using your microphone by clicking on Yes. As soon as you give permission, the voice recording will start.</p>

<h4><strong>Step 4. VoiceOver</strong></h4>

Click on the red bar to access several audio editing options such as splitting, trimming, volume, amongst several option features.</p>

<h4><strong>Step 5. Save the video.</strong></h4>
<p>Time to tidy up as Voice over the video has been added, and the required adjustments have been made. Click on the back button and head to the dashboard from where you found the audio option.  Save the project by clicking on the save video option. Select the video quality form the popped up menu and click on save.</p>

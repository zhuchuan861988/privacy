<p>To make a demo video can give you the space to show rather than tell consumers how it will change their life. Cheaper than a sales team, an online demo also broadens your reach, and you can analyze if or at which point your visitors/viewers drop off.</p>
<p>Fledgling startups shouldn’t be deterred either by lack of budget or experience in the filmmaking world. There is plenty of easy-to-use technology and applications that make the process of demonstrating products on video straightforward and a whole lot of fun.</p>
<p>The following guide takes you through, step-by-step, everything you need to do to make your product demo, including planning, recording, and editing your clips for a seamless output.</p>
<p>It finishes with a cheat sheet of how to create a product demo to pack a punch.</p>
<h2>Step 1. Planning How to Create Product Demo Video Content</h2>
<p>If you’re used to delivering on the fly, you may want to rethink that strategy for your product demo video. Instead, a carefully constructed plan will help you craft a video that achieves your goals. Here’s what you should consider.</p>
<ul>
<li>What’s the goal? Are you trying to boost sales or subscriptions?</li>
<li>Who’s the audience? Do you want customers to return, or are you trying to reach new markets?</li>
<li>Identify the content. Do you want to answer common questions or explain features?</li>
<li>Layout the format. Write down or create a storyboard of how your product demo will be structured.</li>
</ul>
<div id="attachment_433" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-433" src="https://www.ioforth.com/video-editor/img/how-to-make-a-demo-video-2.png" alt="Planning Video Content" width="500" height="300" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Planning Video Content</p></div>
<h2>Step 2. Making the Product Demo Video</h2>
<p>This step depends on whether your product is physical or non-physical like software. How to create demo video content for physical products.</p>
<h3>Use a DSLR if you have one for better quality footage.</h3>
<p>The quality of smartphone cameras, however, is quite suitable for online marketing (shooting in 4K gives you better resolution).</p>
<p>Always use a tripod to keep the camera steady and to avoid shake. A microphone also helps with sound quality while a source of light will minimize weird shadows.</p>
<h3>Editing the Product Demo Video</h3>
<p>Editing is by far the most fun stage of creating product demo video content, but it can also be the most daunting.</p>
<p>Here in this part, the most reliable and great video editing software &#8211; <a href="https://www.ioforth.com/filmforth/">FilmForth</a> is so convenient. As an easy-to-use video editor, FilmForth loaded with many features. For example, <a href="https://www.ioforth.com/video-editor/how-to-trim-videos-on-windows.htm">being able to trim</a>, split and combine videos, or <a href="https://www.ioforth.com/video-editor/voice-recorder-for-pc.htm">add audio </a>and <a href="https://www.ioforth.com/windows-video-transitions/">video transitions</a>.</p>
<p>It means you don’t need the genius to edit videos and you can still use creativity, giving you control over the video’s strength and engagement.</p>
<h3>Trim, split, or combine videos</h3>
<p>Being able to edit your videos means when it comes to shooting your content, you don’t have to perform perfectly the first time around. The video editor allows you to trim clips, or even split them up, or combine different videos. You can also crop out distracting elements or just hone in on what’s important. Compare various shots side by side and play around with their order until your video tells the story you want it to show.</p>

<h2>Transitioning</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.ioforth.com/filmforth/">FilmForth is a video editor </a>that allows you to color correct your footage consistently, <a href="https://www.ioforth.com/video-editor/how-to-add-effects-to-videos.htm">add filters or effects</a>, including those that will enable you to transition smoothly from one scene to another with varying speed and precision, using fades or dissolves for a professional edge.</p>

<h3>Adding Audio</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.ioforth.com/video-editor/how-to-remove-voice-from-video.htm">Adding audio</a> elements can make your product demo video, if you use an audio editing tool, such as that included in video editors like FilmForth. It allows you to tweak the synchronization of sound, so it’s more uniform through the length of the final video, which is particularly pertinent if you’ve combined several video clips.</p>
<p>You can also add recorded music as a background soundtrack or play it on top of the footage, which is an easy way to make your video stand out and engage your audience. And it’s much easier to do than you might think as all you have to do is drop the track onto the video’s timeline.</p>

<h2>Step 3. Now share your final product demo</h2>
<p>Now that you’ve done the work of creating a product demo video, you can share it with your target audience. Social media provides obvious platforms for this if you have relevant channels set up. You can also embed the video on your website or within an email.</p>
<h2>Product Demo Videos for Impact – Cheat Sheet</h2>
<p>Now you know creating product demo video content isn’t difficult; how can you do this with impact?</p>
<ul>
<li>Think benefits rather than features – how will this product better the consumer’s life or solve their problems.</li>
<li>Demonstrate how the product works, step-by-step, without too much detail.</li>
<li>End with a call-to-action. That’s where you go back to why you’re making the video in the first place. Do you want them to buy, give you their email, or try your product for a trial period?</li>
<li>Keep it short and simple. You’re competing with tons of content out there, and attention spans are limited. So, keep the length of the video as short as possible while allowing for an adequate demonstration.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, making a product demo video isn’t difficult. The process is even more natural if you have a good video editor like FilmForth, which can help you make your product demo video, home video, or it can help you start a vlog.

                <p>Turning high resolution, high contrast photos into video is much easier than you believe it to be. It’s something I’ve done often as a freelance business owner and a subject I think would benefit your brand, too. That’s why I decided to create a short guide highlighting how to create video from photos.</p>
<p>The following steps simplify the photo-conversion to the video process by teaching you how to put pictures together to make a video. By the time you’ve gone through the process once or twice, you’ll be able to create video content to share with the greatest of ease. I remember how unsure of myself I was the first time I made a video, and how confident I felt once I watched my work come to life on my website.</p>
<p>Anyone can do this type of video creation. Just follow my lead and the steps listed below for the best results. Once you’ve gotten a feel for the process, you’ll be able to create videos without a lot of editing involved.</p>
<h2>Step 1. Download the Clip-Making Software &#8211; FilmForth</h2>
<p>To do incredible things with the still photos you have available, you must have the software downloaded. It’s the very first step and vital to the photo-converting process.</p>
<p>Without it, you’re not able to take your pictures and turn them into videos. Having regular access to the software allows you to create content whenever you want without delay.</p>
<p>Here I recommend <a href="https://www.ioforth.com/filmforth/">FilmForth</a> as the best free photos to video converter on Windows 10. It supports editing video from clips and <a href="https://www.ioforth.com/photo-conversion-to-video-made-easy/">add stylish transitions</a>, filter, titles, on a timeline.<br />
<a class="micro_dlbtn" href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9nsf023x0mqs?cid=photostovideo" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://www.ioforth.com/img/micordl.png" /></a></p>
<h2>Step 2. Add Photos to the Filmforth Picture Video Maker</h2>
<p>You have many features to choose from with access to the free video maker. For example, you can trim pictures to help you zoom in on the subject you want to focus on. You can also split and combine videos. Adding audio and video transitions allows the video to flow seamlessly while being watched. The more user-friendly and tool-heavy the picture video maker is, the better because you have the most options to choose from at once.</p>
<div id="attachment_395" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-395" src="https://www.ioforth.com/video-editor/img/add-photos-to-filmforth.png" alt="Add Photos to FilmForth" width="800" height="473" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Add Photos to FilmForth</p></div>
<h2>Step 3. Use Filters to Enhance the Look of the Photographs</h2>
<p>Filters can change the look of photos before you convert them into a video. It’s one way to improve the quality of the images to make them look more cohesive. You may have shot the photographs at different times of day and locations. When you use filters, however, no one will know this because you can apply the same filter over all the photos you use for your video. It gives each frame uniformity.</p>
<div id="attachment_396" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-396" src="https://www.ioforth.com/video-editor/img/add-effects-on-photos.png" alt="Add Effects to Photos on FilmForth" width="800" height="473" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Add Effects to Photos on FilmForth</p></div>
<div id="attachment_397" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-397" src="https://www.ioforth.com/video-editor/img/choose-effect-on-photos.png" alt="Choose Effects to Photos on FilmForth" width="800" height="473" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Choose Effects to Photos on FilmForth</p></div>
<h2>Step 4. Animate the Transitions</h2>
<p>You can use audio or video to transition from one subject to the next. Doing so allows you to avoid many of the awkward moments of silence that make videos look like an amateur who created them. You can bridge the gap between different groupings of photos and even use your voice or music to announce a change in the subject presented.</p>
<div id="attachment_398" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-398" src="https://www.ioforth.com/video-editor/img/add-transition-to-photos.png" alt="Add Transitions to Photos on FilmForth" width="800" height="473" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Add Transitions to Photos on FilmForth</p></div>
<div id="attachment_399" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-399" src="https://www.ioforth.com/video-editor/img/select-transitions-to-photos.png" alt="Select Transitions to Photos on FilmForth" width="800" height="473" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Select Transitions to Photos on FilmForth</p></div>
<h2>Step 5. Include Subtitles and Music to Make the Video Stand Out</h2>
<p>Subtitles also help with transitions. It gives the viewer an idea of what to expect next. If you include music with the subtitles, it adds a cinematic quality to your photo converted to a video presentation. More people will feel compelled to watch the content from start to finish when you’ve made it possible for them to understand what to expect next.</p>
<div id="attachment_401" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-401" src="https://www.ioforth.com/video-editor/img/add-text-to-photos.png" alt="Add Text to Photos on FilmForth" width="800" height="473" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Add Text to Photos on FilmForth</p></div>
<div id="attachment_402" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-402" src="https://www.ioforth.com/video-editor/img/add-background-music-to-photos.png" alt="Add Background Music to Photos on FilmForth" width="800" height="473" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Add Background Music to Photos on FilmForth</p></div>
<h2>Step 6. Save the Video You Created</h2>
<p>Saving as you add and edit content is imperative. That way, you don’t lose all the hard work you put into creating your video. I learned this the hard way, and cannot stress this point enough. After spending hours redoing the steps listed here, I make sure to save my progress regularly to avoid the headache.</p>
<div id="attachment_403" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-403" src="https://www.ioforth.com/video-editor/img/save-video.png" alt="Save and export your videos via FilmForth" width="800" height="473" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Save and export your videos via FilmForth</p></div>
<h2>Step 7. Upload It to the Platform of Your Choice</h2>
<p>You’re one step closer to seeing your hard work pay off. Upload the video to the platform you plan on using for sharing video content. Make sure that the file size and type match the requirement of the site. If it doesn’t, you’ll find it very difficult to get your video to post.</p>
<h2>Step 8. Watch the Video and Correct Any Errors Before Making It Live</h2>
<p>Before releasing your video content into the wild, it’s wise to view it a few times to see how it flows. If you identify any errors while watching it, write down the time it occurred so you can make corrections quickly. Once you’re 100 percent satisfied with the final video, you can make it live and start promoting it for increased views.</p>
<p>Wyzowl reports that 80 percent of marketing done by video has increased sales. It could potentially help you, too, once you’ve learned how to work with the video creating program. You’ll have far greater success introducing g mobile users to your website or social media accounts where they’re more likely to remember the core message of your content when they view it.</p>
<h2>Add Video Content Using Photos is Now a Possibility for You</h2>
<p>Now that you know how to convert photos to video, you’ll be able to use the option on your website and social media accounts regularly. You can showcase your products with high-quality photographs in a slideshow style format for your customers to see. They can view the pictures that you took while visiting another country or during a behind-the-scenes tour of your business. However you decide to use the photos, one thing’s certain. They’ll make a fantastic video presentation once you’ve had some practice using a picture video editor.</p>

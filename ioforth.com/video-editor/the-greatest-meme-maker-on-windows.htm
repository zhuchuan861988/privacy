                </div>
                <p>Memes have transcended through the boulevard of the Internet. They range from subjects such as politics to college humor.</p>
<p>Meme culture has become an integral part of the modern Internet. It has become a big part of how we communicate online. They are not merely part of a niche, inside jokes anymore &#8211; Memes disseminate information across the masses, ranging from Spongebob memes to planned political campaigns.</p>
<p>To an average netizen, a meme is a funny video, photo, caption, or a classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickrolling">Rickroll</a>. However, there is more to the origin of the word meme.</p>
<p>With its ancient greek connections, the word was coined by Richard Dawkins, an evolutionary scientist, who used it to describe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme#Criticism_of_meme_theory">meme theory</a> in his book,<em> The Selfish Gene</em>.</p>
<h2>Evolution of Internet Memes</h2>
<p>Amongst the first to go viral on the Internet was the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5x5OXfe9KY&amp;ab_channel=uninvitedinno">baby of a video dancing</a>, originally posted on YouTube. It became a viral sensation across different formats, primarily seen on blogs, websites in the form of a GIF.</p>
<p>The worldwide web grew, and forums like 4chan, Ebaum&#8217;s world saw the early prevalence of memes.</p>
<p>Early meme formats focused on captions on a photo, primarily with top and bottom text.</p>
<div id="attachment_155" style="width: 247px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-155 size-medium" src="https://www.ioforth.com/video-editor/img/the-greatest-meme-maker-on-windows-237x300.jpg" alt="Chuck Norris" width="237" height="300" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Chuck Norris</p></div>
<p>The Chuck Norris facts(hyperbolic demigod status to Chuck Norris, as a part of the Internet joke) made rounds worldwide.</p>
<p>After that, we rolled into 2007, pivoting to videos. And everyone was <em>rick-rolled</em> into watching the YouTube video of Rick Astley performing “Never Gonna Give You Up” as the song’s official music video.</p>
<p>As the harmless Internet prank picked up, you could find it prominently on forums like 4chan, Ebaum, and social media sites like MySpace and Orkut. Any suspicions during the link were either a rick-roll or malware, majorly the former.</p>
<p>To this day, Reddit has kept up the meme tradition, and you can find some rick-rolls now and then by the users.</p>
<p>Twitter and Tumblr were becoming the next destination in the new decade of the 2000s. People looked into something better than Facebook for humor and funnies in general.</p>
<p>Reddit and Instagram have been on the forefront ever since for the memes and giggles.</p>
<h2>Create Your memes &#8211; Meme&#8217;ing By Yourself</h2>
<p>Creating memes is as easy as drinking water. All you need is a meme template, and place your text on it—the simplest form of memes.</p>

<ul>

<ul>
<li>Picture in Picture</li>

<ul>
<li>Meme Maker</li>
</ul>
<p>Online meme editor apps often have certain limits for free users. Publish all your memes with few simple clicks and forget about the online meme editors.</p>
<ul>
<li>Separate Audio and Use your Own</li>
</ul>
<p>There can be a plethora of reasons why you would want to <a href="https://www.ioforth.com/video-editor/how-to-remove-voice-from-video.htm">detach audio from a video</a>. It can range from low sound quality to doing a complete voice-over for tutorials.</p>
<p>Detaching the audio is the easiest part. Click on the Detach Audio button, and it will be done in a few seconds. Add your audio by using the add audio button.</p>
<h3>Edit video in FilmForth</h3>
<p>Editing videos with FilmForth is easier than you would imagine. There are no hidden settings, as we have already discussed. Everything is right on the screen.</p>
<p>Step 1. On the home screen, click on the New Project button for editing a new video.</p>
<p>It will open the dashboard where you can edit both videos and photos. You can either manually browse to locate the media or simply drag n drop the file that needs to be edited.</p>
<p>Step 2. Here, we have taken a video from a free video repository for the sake of a demonstration.</p>
<div id="attachment_159" style="width: 990px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-159" src="https://www.ioforth.com/video-editor/img/the-greatest-meme-maker-on-windows-1.png" alt="FilmForth - Video Editor" width="980" height="685" /><p class="wp-caption-text">FilmForth &#8211; Video Editor</p></div>
<p>Step 3. After the video has been loaded; now it is time to tweak the video as per your liking.</p>
<h4>Editing/Adding Audio</h4>
<p>Since there is no audio in the video, let&#8217;s start from there.</p>
<p>Step 4. Click on the + button, which says Add Audio. There you will come across two ways to add a video.</p>
<p>First, add a local audio file, or add a voice over to the video. While the former has a suggested tab, which recommends music from its library, it can be added.</p>
<div id="attachment_161" style="width: 990px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-161" src="https://www.ioforth.com/video-editor/img/the-greatest-meme-maker-on-windows-5.png" alt="Add Audio from Computer" width="980" height="775" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Add Audio from Computer</p></div>
<p>The latter comes in handy when doing a tutorial or a presentation video of sorts. Professional creators who are just starting out can really take advantage of the feature.</p>
<p>Step 5. Once you are done selecting the audio, there is room for further adjustments.</p>
<h4>Trim:</h4>
<p>Don&#8217;t like the entire audio track? Trim it down to your favorites and add it to the instead.</p>
<h4>Speed:</h4>
<p>Some music tracks can be slower than you would have anticipated. The slogging tempo can throw off the momentum of the entire video. Speed the audio up to 4x. Additionally, you can slow it down to 0.25x as well.</p>
<h4>Volume:</h4>
<p>Fade in and fade out the audio as you tread through the video. Control the audio volume as well, as the overpowering volume levels can sometimes put off the viewers.</p>
<div id="attachment_162" style="width: 990px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-162" src="https://www.ioforth.com/video-editor/img/the-greatest-meme-maker-on-windows-6.png" alt=" Change the Volume with FilmForth" width="980" height="775" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Change the Volume with FilmForth</p></div>
<h3>Adding Visuals to the Video</h3>
<p>As the audio part has tidied up, let&#8217;s move to the visual aspect.</p>
<p>Step 1. Add a picture, face, or anything to the video. The face comes in useful for creating memes, where a face is added on top of another face.</p>
<p>Step 2. Click on the Add Pic in Pic button and browser the picture that you want to add to the video.</p>
<div id="attachment_163" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-large wp-image-163" src="https://www.ioforth.com/video-editor/img/the-greatest-meme-maker-on-windows-7.png" alt="Add Picture in Picture with FilmForth" width="1024" height="809" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Add Picture in Picture with FilmForth</p></div>
<p>After adding the pic, you can flip the pic through the Flip option; set a time duration for which the picture will appear in the video through the Set Start button.</p>
<h3>Adding Text</h3>
<p>Add subtitles, captions to the video through the Text option, which can be accessed by clicking on the Text option from the project&#8217;s home screen.</p>
<p>Step 1. Click on the Add Text button in the Text dashboard, and a text box will appear on the screen.</p>
<p>Step 2. Type in the text you wish to add while choosing the appropriate font, size.</p>
<div id="attachment_165" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-165 size-large" src="https://www.ioforth.com/video-editor/img/the-greatest-meme-maker-on-windows-9.png" alt="Type in the Text" width="1024" height="809" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Type in the Text</p></div>
<p>Step 3. Click outside the box, and the text will appear on the video. You can place it anywhere on the screen as per your requirements.</p>
<p>In case you want to add different captions for various segments of the video, you can trim the duration of the caption through Set Start and Set End options. Alternatively, resize the blue text bar from the editor feed to set the segment duration for the text.</p>
<h3>Editing the Visual of the Video</h3>
<p>Click on the video feed, which is the topmost layer. Head to the Edit option from the home screen of the project.</p>
<p>Step 1. Add effects or filters to the video for providing aesthetic flair to the video. Effects are ranging from the retro 1977 to the pre-industrial era Willow.</p>
<p>Step 2. Flip the video turning it from left to right, or vice-versa. The flip will invert the video, which will make it seem like a video from a different point of origin.</p>
<h3>Click on the Flip button once to invert the video.</h3>
<p>Step 1. You can also Rotate the video by clicking on the Rotate button. Every click on the button rotates it by 90 degrees to the right or clockwise.</p>
<p>Step 2. Remove the audio by clicking the Detach Audio option, which will erase, mute any video that is contained in the video by default.</p>
<h3>Saving the Video</h3>
<p>Once everything is wrapped up, and you feel content with the video edit, it&#8217;s time to save it. Save the video by clicking on the Save Video button present on the project&#8217;s home screen.</p>
<div id="attachment_166" style="width: 990px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-166" src="https://www.ioforth.com/video-editor/img/the-greatest-meme-maker-on-windows-12.png" alt="Saving the Video " width="980" height="775" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Saving the Video</p></div>
<p>There are a handful of video qualities in which you can publish your video. Over time 1080p has become the bare minimum for video content and platforms, while 4K is catching up.</p>
<div id="attachment_167" style="width: 990px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-167" src="https://www.ioforth.com/video-editor/img/the-greatest-meme-maker-on-windows-11.png" alt="Select the Export Location" width="980" height="687" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Select the Export Location</p></div>
<p>After selecting the export location, it will take a couple of seconds or minutes to save, depending on the video&#8217;s size.</p>

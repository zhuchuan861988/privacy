                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>If you’ve looked up how to rotate a video in Windows 10, you’ve probably realized there are many ways to do so, and that’s because there are a lot of video editing apps available on the market. But today, I want to show you the easiest method you’ll find to rotate a video, which means you can get your video to rotate like this in just 6 easy steps:</p>
<h2>Step 1. Choose &amp; Install A Video Editor</h2>
<p>In this post, I will recommend <a href="https://www.ioforth.com/filmforth/">FilmForth</a> as the one to rotate the video. FilmForth is a quite easy-to-use video editor in the market even if you have no previous experience with video editing apps. Also, it’s available for free on the Windows store, so it’s effortless to download and install. What&#8217;s more, you can save the video without a watermark with FilmForth.</p>
<p>Now, to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9nsf023x0mqs?cid=rotatevideo" rel="nofollow">download FilmForth</a>, and let&#8217;s start the video flip journey.</p>
<p><a class="micro_dlbtn" href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9nsf023x0mqs?cid=rotatevideo" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://www.ioforth.com/img/micordl.png" /></a></p>
<p>Take into account that Windows 10 will automatically handle the installation, and it should be ready to use within 3 to 5 minutes.</p>
<h2>Step 2. Create a project</h2>
<p>Once FilmForth is installed on your computer, you’ll need to open the video editor and create a project. To do so, open FilmForth and click on New Project or Open a Project as shown below.</p>
<div id="attachment_134" style="width: 990px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-134" src="https://www.ioforth.com/video-editor/img/filmforth-overview.png" alt="FilmForth Overview" width="980" height="495" /><p class="wp-caption-text">FilmForth Overview</p></div>
<p>A window titled “Create a New Project” will appear with the following fields:</p>
<div id="attachment_192" style="width: 912px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-192 size-full" src="https://www.ioforth.com/video-editor/img/how-to-add-effects-to-videos-1.png" alt="Create a New Project" width="902" height="639" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Create a New Project</p></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Project Name:</strong> This is the name of your FilmForth project. Once you’ve finished with the editing process, your progress will be saved in a file with this name, so you’ll be able to continue editing your video in the future. Give it any name you wish.</li>
<li><strong>Aspect Ratio:</strong> just leave this as it is, I’ll explain to you what aspect ratio is in step 6.</li>
<li><strong>Path:</strong> It is where your project will be saved. It’s set by default to Videos\FilmForth\Projects but you can change it to wherever you wish to save it.<br />
Once you’re ready to hop on the editor, simply click on Create.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Step 3. Upload your video files</h2>
<p>Once your project has been created, add the video files you want to rotate into your project by clicking the ADD VIDEO/PHOTO CLIPS button as shown below.</p>
<div id="attachment_136" style="width: 990px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-136" src="https://www.ioforth.com/video-editor/img/add-video-photo.png" alt="Add Video/Photo Clips" width="980" height="485" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Add Video/Photo Clips</p></div>
<p>You can add as many files as you wish, but I’d recommend sticking to one for now just to make sure you rotate the video properly.</p>
<h2>Step 4. Rotate the clip</h2>
<p>This is where the magic happens. You see, the process on how to rotate videos is really simple. Once the video you wish to rotate has been added to the timeline, click on edit.</p>
<div id="attachment_344" style="width: 990px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-344" src="https://www.ioforth.com/video-editor/img/how-to-rotate-a-video-2.jpg" alt="Click on Edit to Start to Rotate the Video" width="980" height="643" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Click on Edit to Start to Rotate the Video</p></div>
<p>Then click on “Rotate”, as shown below.</p>
<div id="attachment_345" style="width: 1000px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-345" src="https://www.ioforth.com/video-editor/img/how-to-rotate-a-video-3.jpg" alt="Click on Rotate to Rotate the Video " width="990" height="650" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Click on Rotate to Rotate the Video</p></div>
<p>And that’s it! That’s how simple it is to rotate a video using FilmForth.</p>
<p>Take into account that each time you click “Rotate”, your video will rotate 90 degrees, so if you want to give it a 180° rotation, you’ll need to click two times.</p>
<h2>Step 5. Make the Video Look Great</h2>
<p>After rotating the video, take some time to experiment with the video editor to make sure it looks great.</p>
<p>For example, you can <a href="https://www.ioforth.com/video-editor/how-to-add-effects-to-videos.htm">add different video effects</a> and filters to it or <a href="https://www.ioforth.com/windows-video-transitions/">apply some transitions</a>. There are many options to choose from, and I’m sure your video will look much better if you take some time to try and improve it.</p>
<p>Plus, like rotating videos, editing them is also really easy too! You can view all of the editing options under the Edit button.</p>
<p>Finally, you can also <a href="https://www.ioforth.com/best-voice-recording-software-in-windows/">add music (or audio effects)</a> and pictures to your video, by simply clicking the Audio button or the Picture in Picture button, respectively.</p>
<h2>Step 6. Export Video</h2>
<p>Now, export the rotated video and convert it into an actual video file (.mp4 in this case). Click on Save Video, select the folder where you wish to save it.</p>
<div id="attachment_349" style="width: 990px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-349" src="https://www.ioforth.com/video-editor/img/how-to-rotate-a-video-5.jpg" alt="Click on Save Video to Export Video" width="980" height="643" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Click on Save Video to Export Video</p></div>
<p>Depending on the duration of your video, you might need to wait a few minutes to get it exported. Once this process is complete, you’ll be able to share or upload it wherever you wish to.</p>
<h2>Aspect Ratios</h2>
<p>If you want to upload your video, you’ll need to know precisely what aspect ratio means. Otherwise, you might end up uploading a vertical video to YouTube, or a horizontal video to your IG stories, which is far from ideal.</p>
<p>An aspect ratio is a proportional relationship between a video’s width and height.</p>
<p>So if you have a video with a 1:1 aspect ratio, it means your video will be square because the width and height will have the same length.</p>
<p>It’s crucial you remember that the format for aspect ratio is width: height, meaning the width comes first, and the height second.</p>
<p>There are many aspect ratios, with the main ones being:</p>
<ul>
<li>16:9 which is the basic widescreen ratio.</li>
<li>9:16 is the aspect ratio most phones use, and as you can guess by its name, it’s the exact flip of the basic widescreen ratio.</li>
<li>16:10 which is used mainly for computer screens.</li>
<li>And 4:3 is a classic ratio that is rarely used. Old TVs mostly used it, but nowadays the majority of them have an aspect ratio of 16:9.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What aspect ratio should your video have?</h2>
<p>Well, that depends on where you want to upload your video.</p>
<ul>
<li>For YouTube and Facebook, a 16:9 aspect ratio is ideal.</li>
<li>For Instagram posts, you have a variety of options, but the ones I’d recommend are 1:1 (square), 4:5 (portrait), or 1.91:1 (landscape).</li>
<li>For Instagram and Facebook stories, 9:16 is the best.</li>
<li>For IGTV, you can use both 9:16 and 16:9.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember to take this into account when filming a video. If you want to upload it to Instagram, try to shoot it vertically so you can stick to a 9:16 aspect ratio, otherwise just film it horizontally.</p>
<p>Nowadays, many people recommend shooting your video vertically, as 3 out of 5 videos are viewed on a mobile device.</p>
<p>Personally, if I’m making a video that is meant to be shared with friends and family, then I’ll shoot it vertically, but if the video is meant to be uploaded to video platforms, I’ll shoot it horizontally. The decision is yours.</p>
<h2>Can you rotate a video on YouTube?</h2>
<p>This is a question many people have asked me since they wanted to upload a video to YouTube, but they didn’t want to rotate it by downloading an app.</p>
<p>The thing is a few years ago YouTube received an update on which they removed their editing functionalities, which means you won’t be able to rotate videos there. So if you need to rotate a video, you should do so before uploading it to the platform.</p>
<h2>Other tools you can use to rotate video.</h2>
<p>Obviously, FilmForth is not the only video editing tool you can use to rotate videos, but it’s the one that will make the task easiest for you.</p>
<p>Also, remember that Film Forth is totally free to download and contains no watermark. In case you want to try other Windows 10 apps, here is a few of them that can also get the task done:</p>
<ul>
<li>Video converter Wondershare</li>
<li>DaVinci Resolve</li>
<li>VLC Media Player</li>
<li>If you’re on Mac, Apple iMovie</li>
<li>And if you’re on mobile, you can use Inshot which is available for both Android and iOS</li>
</ul>

<p>To make your video look more professional, you’ll need to add transitions to shift from one scene to the other naturally. But how can you do that on Windows 10? Well, that’s what I’m going to show you today!</p>
<h2>What Is A Video Transition Effect?</h2>
<p><strong>A transition effect is a post-production technique used in film or video editing to connect a clip or scene to the next.</strong> Without it, your video will look jumpy and amateurish, rather than smooth and professional.</p>
<p>But what is a slide? Well, a slide is something that takes place on your editing timeline. It could be an image or a video clip. These slides are displayed one after the other in your timeline, so your goal when editing a video should be to make the transition from one slide to the next as smooth as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s an example of a transition effect made with FilmForth:</strong></p>
<div class="wp-caption alignnone">
	<video class="iof_video" loading="lazy" autoplay loop muted playsinline>  
	  <source src="https://www.ioforth.com/video-editor/img/transitions-video.webm" type="video/webm">  
	  <source src="https://www.ioforth.com/video-editor/img/transitions-video.mp4" type="video/mp4">  
	</video>
	<p class="wp-caption-text">Transition Effects Example</p>
</div>
<h2>How to Add Transition Effects to Your Video</h2>
<p>A transition can be applied to clips automatically which can make the clips, images, videos more smooth and more amazing. With that in mind, let’s start with the tutorial…</p>
<h3>Step 1 – Pick Your Video Editing Software</h3>
<p>With so many editing apps available on the market, you’re probably wondering what would be the ideal tool for the job.</p>
<p>Well, for this tutorial, we’re going to use <a href="https://www.ioforth.com/filmforth/">FilmForth</a>, a free video editor that is simple to use and navigate (even if you have no previous experience with editing apps).</p>
<p>And the best part? Unlike the rest of the editors available on the market, it’s watermark-free! Meaning that once you’ve finished editing your video, you can save it and watch it without an annoying watermark.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9nsf023x0mqs?cid=transitions">To download FilmForth</a>, simply click the image below to get it directly from the Microsoft Store.</p>
<p><a class="micro_dlbtn" href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9nsf023x0mqs?cid=transitions" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://www.ioforth.com/img/micordl.png" /></a></p>
<p>As a side note, if you’re looking for a good video editor that includes transitions, but for Mac, I’d recommend iMovie. If you’re on mobile, then Inshot is what I’d recommend, a photos app that also has video editing and is available for both Android and iOS.</p>
<h3>Step 2 – Create A New Project</h3>
<p>Once <a href="https://www.ioforth.com/filmforth/">FilmForth</a> is installed, simply launch the app and click on “New Project” as shown below.</p>
<div id="attachment_475" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-475" src="https://www.ioforth.com/video-editor/img/video-editor-transitions-1.png" alt="Click New Project to Start " width="800" height="473" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Click New Project to Start</p></div>
<p>A window titled “Create a New Project” will appear. You can leave everything by default or change the fields you wish to. As you can see, I changed the project name to “VideoTransition.”</p>
<p>Once you’ve finished editing them, simply click on “Create” as shown below.</p>
<div id="attachment_476" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-476" src="https://www.ioforth.com/video-editor/img/video-editor-transitions-2.png" alt="Tap Create on FilmForth" width="800" height="473" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Tap Create on FilmForth</p></div>
<h3>Step 3 – Upload Your Video Content</h3>
<p>For this step, you’ll add the video clips you wish to edit in FilmForth.</p>
<p>Remember, you can make a transition between two different clips, but you can also cut a clip in different parts and make a transition between each of those parts. The decision is up to you.</p>
<p>Once your project has been created, you’ll have to add the files to your project by clicking the “ADD VIDEO/PHOTO CLIPS” button, as shown below.</p>
<div id="attachment_477" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-477" src="https://www.ioforth.com/video-editor/img/video-editor-transitions-3.png" alt="Add Photos/Video Clips on FilmForth" width="800" height="473" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Add Photos/Video Clips on FilmForth</p></div>
<p>You can add as many files as you wish, and for this tutorial, we’ll be adding two different clips. I’d recommend sticking to one or two for this tutorial. This depends on whether you want to want to make a transition between two parts of the same clip, or if you’re going to make a transition between two different clips.</p>
<h3>Step 4 – Determine Where To Apply A Video Transition</h3>
<p>You have two options here. If you wish to apply a transition between two different video files, I’ll explain how to do it in the next step.</p>
<p>But if you wish to add a transition using only one file, then you’ll need to split it. To do so, start by positioning where you want to make the cut.</p>
<p>For example, in this case, we’re going to make a cut in the middle of the video. So I’ll position there as shown below.</p>
<div id="attachment_479" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-479" src="https://www.ioforth.com/video-editor/img/position-where-you-want-to-cut.png" alt="Put the Yellow Marker to Where You Want to Cut" width="800" height="591" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Put the Yellow Marker to Where You Want to Cut</p></div>
<p>Then, go into Edit, and click on “Split”</p>
<div id="attachment_480" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-480" src="https://www.ioforth.com/video-editor/img/split-the-file.png" alt="Split the File on FilmForth" width="800" height="591" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Split the File on FilmForth</p></div>
<p>If you’ve done it correctly, your video in the timeline will now be split and have a square between the two parts of it, and it should look like this:</p>
<div id="attachment_481" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-481" src="https://www.ioforth.com/video-editor/img/divide-the-file-into-two-parts.png" alt="Divide the File into Two Parts" width="800" height="625" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Divide the File into Two Parts</p></div>
<p>As you can see, it’s now divided by 2!</p>
<p>Take into account that you can split your files as many times as you need, in any place you wish to. You just need to position the red marker where you want to make another cut, and click on “Split” again… simple as that.</p>
<h3>Step 5 – Pick &amp; Insert Your Video Transition</h3>
<p>Now that your video files are ready, it’s time to make the transition!</p>
<p>Simply click the white square that is located between your clips, as shown below.</p>
<div id="attachment_483" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-483" src="https://www.ioforth.com/video-editor/img/tap-white-square.png" alt="Tap the White Square on FilmForth" width="800" height="544" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Tap the White Square on FilmForth</p></div>
<p>Once you’ve done so, a new window will appear. You’ll need to select the type of transition you wish to add, along with the duration. For this example, I’m going to choose the “Move Left” transition, and a transition duration of 0.2s, as shown below.</p>
<div id="attachment_484" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-484" src="https://www.ioforth.com/video-editor/img/choose-transition-effect.png" alt="Choose the Transition Effects You Want on FilmForth" width="800" height="544" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Choose the Transition Effects You Want on FilmForth</p></div>
<p>There are lots of transition effects on FilmForth. Tap on the effects, you will see how the effects work within the file.</p>
<p>Once you’ve selected the type of transition and its duration, simply click the blue button arrow that’s located on the bottom left to go back to the timeline, and your video clips will now have a transition!</p>
<p>Finally, it’s worth mentioning that if you change your opinion and you wish to change the transition and its duration again, you can do so by simply clicking again on the square that’s between the clips.</p>
<h3>Step 6 — Save &amp; Export</h3>
<p>For the final step, we’re going to convert your project into an actual video (mp4 in this case), so you can view, upload, and share it.</p>
<p>So, when you’ve finished applying a transition, simply click on “Save Video,” select the folder where you wish for it to be saved, and that’s it!</p>
<div id="attachment_485" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-485" src="https://www.ioforth.com/video-editor/img/save-file.png" alt="Export the File " width="800" height="544" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Export the File</p></div>
<p>Once you click on “Save Video”, your movie will start exporting. Take into account that depending on its duration, you might need to wait a few minutes for this process to finish.</p>
<p>That’s it, your video is now ready. That’s how easy it is to apply a video transition with FilmForth.</p>
<h2>Video Tutorial for How to Add Transition Effects to A Video</h2>
<div class="iframe_video"><iframe style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" class='lozad' data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C7BDniRinhY" width="100%" height="100%" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<p>Now you’re ready to share and upload your video! But before you do so, I’d recommend experimenting with FilmForth and applying some filters and effects. You can view all of the editing options available on FilmForth under the “Edit” button</p>
<p>Plus, you can also add music to it by clicking the “Audio” button.</p>
<h2>Video Transition Tips to Keep In Mind</h2>
<p>If you don’t know where and how to apply transitions, you may end up overdoing them. A mistake that will make you look like an amateur video editor.</p>
<p>So, here are some tips to help you decide where and how to apply them to achieve a professional look for your videos.</p>
<h2>Keep It Simple</h2>
<p>Unless you’re creating a Hollywood hit, you should stick to simplicity. In the end, a video is a way to give your message the highest impact possible, so you need to avoid distracting the viewer with flashy transition effects.</p>
<p>Plus, you generally don’t want people to notice your transitions as something that stands out. Ideally, they should flow with the rest of your footage</p>
<p>Therefore, sticking to simple transition types like a fade to black or a cross dissolve should get the job done well for most of your projects.</p>
<h2>Consistency is Key</h2>
<p>There are many types of transition effects, but that doesn’t mean you need to use all of them for your video.</p>
<p>Make sure to be consistent when editing videos and stick to a maximum of two types of transition per video, to avoid confusing your audience.</p>
<p>Plus, using a different transition for every different scene is a common amateur mistake, so avoid it at all costs.</p>
<p>Again, video transitions are not meant to stand out, but to help make the video flow smoothly.</p>
<h2>Avoid Overuse</h2>
<p>For your video to look good and professional you’ll need to add transition effects.</p>
<p>Just don’t be that person that adds flashy transitions to every new section of the video. There is definitely a limit to how many you add.</p>
<p>Ideally, you should focus on using a few key transitions per video and the viewer should not even notice them.</p>
<h3>Stick to Using Transitions When:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Changing from one setting to another</li>
<li>Highlighting a change of direction or mood</li>
<li>Creating a speed loop to visualize a lasting process</li>
</ol>
<p>The key to great transitions is to time your video edits well. Stick to using your transitions at the end of paragraphs, sentences, or sections and avoid using them mid-sentence.</p>
<h2>Keep It Smooth</h2>
<p>This goes along with the first point. You see, when applying a transition, you need to make everything seem smooth and natural, not forced.</p>
<p>By keeping each transition smooth, your video won’t look jumpy, but polished. Doing so will help your viewers concentrate on the message you are trying to get across, rather than on who edited the video or the different types of effects you can see on it.</p>
<h2>Applying Transitions FAQ’s</h2>
<h3>What transitions are included in FilmForth?</h3>
<p>At the moment, FilmForth offers more than 40 transition effects. And we’re keeping working on it and planning to update more asap. So more great transition effects will come in future updates!</p>
<h3>Can I use Windows Movie Maker to make a video transition?</h3>
<p>This is a question many people probably have, seeing that Movie Maker used to be a really popular tool for video editing (especially for beginners) back in the day, but it was removed and discontinued at the start of 2017, and it’s no longer available for Windows 10.</p>
<p>Another question people ask me is if they can use YouTube to edit their video and add a transition, and the answer is also negative. YouTube removed their editing toolset a few years ago, which means that if you wish to upload a video to YouTube, you should edit it before doing so.</p>
<p>That’s one of the main reasons I decided to create FilmForth since I wanted to give people a free editor of videos that would be simple to use and easy to work with (like Movie Maker used to be)… So why don’t you give it a try? I’m sure you’ll like it!</p>
<h3>Can I make “professional” transitions with FilmForth?</h3>
<p>Sure, yes!</p>
<p>With more updates coming along, FilmForth can meet more and more needs. As it owns over 40 transition effects, basically it would full fill all kinds of transition needs.</p>
<p>Also, FilmForth is a tool aimed at beginners and people who wish to edit their videos with simplicity. So no matter you are a skilled video maker or a new video editing learner, FilmForth would be a nice choice.</p>
<p>Most of us know Adobe After Effects or DaVinci Resolve. They are absolutely professional video editors. But be aware, unlike FilmForth, those editors are not simple to use. They have a higher learning curve, so it will take you a lot of time to understand how to use and operate them.</p>
<h3>Are transition effects free in FilmForth?</h3>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>Unlike other video editors that will charge you for using certain features, all transitions, filters, and other types of effects are free in <a href="https://www.ioforth.com/filmforth/">FilmForth</a>, and we plan on them to continue being that way.</p>

            <h4>Planning</h4>
            <p>Working with video editing usually starts with a plan.Whether you create an outline with a few notes on a scrap of paper or get into great detail for a longer production, planning is a virtual necessity for success in envisioning and creating your final product. You will need to work through the following steps:</p>
            <p>a. <b>Plan</b> — Outline your ideas, the message you have and the story you want to tell. It may take some time to collect your ideas, but doing that will be worth the effort when it comes to production. One thing you will want to consider if you will be making a video series is to work at creating recurring elements. For example you may want to have a standardized introduction and an ending that provides useful information, presents your logo and links to other resources you want to advertise. It may be good to use some recurring elements, a particular graphic theme and have a color scheme in mind. These are things you want to create and save to give your video better production quality and a more professional feel.</p>
            <p>b. <b>Collect</b> — Gather the parts for your video. This could mean recording appropriate video segments, collecting photos, locating quotes, listing step-by-step procedures, creating or obtaining audio components (possibly scripts for voice-overs), etc. If you are going to use a logo you’ll want to create and save that separately along with your lead in and other reusable graphics.</p>
            <p>c. <b>Assemble</b> — Add the objects you have collected to your video project.</p>
            <p>d. <b>Revise</b> — Edit the order transitions and timing within the video.</p>
            <p>e. <b>Save & Export</b> — Save the video project and export it for use.</p>
            <p>f. <b>Publish</b> — Publish or present your video.</p>
            
            <a id="creating" class="parts part3"></a>
            <h4>Creating Your Project</h4>
            <p>1. Launch FilmForth. This can be done from the Start menu after installation by clicking the FilmForth program icon alphabetically listed under ‘F’. The Home screen will appear.</p>
            <p>2. Here you will see the <b>[New Project]</b> button and the <b>[Open a Project]</b>. Click the <b>[New Project]</b>, you will open the Create a New Project screen.</p>

            <p>Pictures and video objects are one of the most important parts of your video project. FilmForth can import many image and video types to help you on your way to completing your project.</p>
            <p>FilmForth supports all of the image and video types in the following Table 3. The type of file matters because it can affect the image quality (e.g., color depth and compression type) and features (e.g., animation and transparency).</p>

            <p>Pictures and videos are a key component of videos you will create in FilmForth.Adding them from existing files is simple.</p>
            <p>1. Open the project you want to add pictures or video to in FilmForth.</p>
            <p>2. Click the Add Object [+] button to the right on the Timeline display. A <b>Windows Open</b> screen will appear.</p>

            <p>4. Click on the object to highlight it in the file panel.</p>
            <p>5. Click <b>[Open]</b>. The object will be added to the project timeline immediately after the last object in the timeline.</p>

            <p>To apply the functions just click on the feature. The descriptions for each object appear in Table 4 and contain any additional information necessary for applying the tool. Controls are context sensitive because still pictures and video objects are fundamentally different. Exit all features using the blue [Back] arrow to the left of the feature bar.</p>

            <p>While the Picture-in-a-Picture feature functions in a similar way to other graphic objects, using it can add dimension and production quality to your videos. A simple example would be to insert a video of someone doing a voice over for the main video behind them. There are interesting and creative ways to use this feature that go well beyond a simple timeline.Of course you will want to plan what you are going to do and have the image and/or video components already created and available.</p>

            <h4>Adding a Picture-in-a-Picture</h4>
            <p>1. With a project open that already has graphic objects on the timeline, click the Picture-in-Picture feature on the bottom bar of the project screen. This will open the Picture-in-a-Picture functions.</p>

        	<h2>Exporting Videos</h2>
            <p>The project files for your productions are created in a proprietary format and can not be distributed for use in presentations. This is why exporting your video is an important last step in the process of video creation. Once the video is created you can then distribute it and use it for presentation.</p>
            <p>FilmForth has made the process of exporting extremely easy. You can use the Export feature to distribute your videos or to create components that you can reuse such as video intros and branding material. You will still be able to edit your projects after exporting using the original project files.</p>
            <a id="exportingvideo"></a>
            <h4>Exporting Your Video</h4>
            <p>1. Open the project that you would like to export for distribution.</p>
            <p>2. Click on the red <b>[Export]</b> button in the upper right panel of the FilmForth project screen. This will open a Windows <b>[Save As]</b> navigation window.</p>
            <p>3. Navigate to the place where you want to store the video file.</p>
            <p>4. [Optional] Select the video file type you want to save as. MP4 will be the default file type. Please see Adding Pictures and Video for more information on file types.</p>
            <p>5. [Optional] Rename the file to something you will remember. By default, FilmForth will use the project name and the file type selected.</p>
            <p>6. Click <b>[Save]</b> and the video file will be generated and stored in the place you have indicated. Depending on how complex your creation is, saving may take some time. A progress screen will appear and then a screen confirming that the video has been successfully generated.</p>

            </div>
            <p>7. [Optional] Click <b>[Show in Folder]</b> to open Windows Explorer at the location of the file.</p>
            <p>8. [Optional] Double-click the file to check that the playback has generated successfully.</p>
            <p>9. Click the <b>[Close]</b> button to close the Export Confirmation screen.</p>
            <p>With the file generated you can now distribute it. As long as a proper file type has been selected the video should be compatible with a broad range of video viewing apps and browsers.</p>
